started","keywords":"","body":"Getting started\nBauhaus is a single page application built with React and Redux. It was bootstraped with Create React App and designed thanks to Bootstrap. To run the application in development mode, run the following commands from a shell prompt in the local directory, and then navigate to http://localhost:3000:\n# Download all the dependencies needed by the application\nyarn install\n# Compiles the code and starts a minimal web server\nyarn start\n`\nWe discovered an error when using the command `yarn start` with a path containing accentuated characters. If this is also the case for you, you can also usr the command `npm start` instead of `yarn start`.\n\nApplication needs externals Web services : Bauhaus-Back-Office(https://github.com/InseeFr/Bauhaus-Back-Office).\n\n## Test\n\n`yarn test` runs the test watcher in an interactive mode. By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.\nAn other script, `yarn test:coverage` allows to generate a complete local report `Bauhaus/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`.\n\nSome Integrations tests are also available thanks to _Cypress.io_. You should use the `yarn cypress:open` command if you want to launch these tests on dev mode. For your CI, you have to use the `yarn cypress:run` command.\n\nUnit tests are launched each time a `git push` is executed.\n\n## Build\n\nTo build the application, run `yarn build`. You can now serve the content of the `dist` folder with the HTTP server of your choice.\n\n### Docker\n\nYou can also build a Docker container :\n\n```shell\ndocker build . -t bauhaus-front\nAnd run it :\ndocker run  -it -p 8083:80 -e BAUHAUS_API_URL=http://192.168.1.12:8081/api bauhaus-front\n\nhttp://192.168.1.12:8081/api is the base URL of the Bauhaus API.\nNew to JavaScript and Node.js\nIf you're new to JavaScript, you might need to first install node and yarn on your computer.\nyarn is the Node.js package manager. yarn install will download all the dependencies needed by the project, as described in the dependencies and devDepedencies sections of the package.json file.\nyarn start will launch the dev command defined in the scripts section of the same package.json file. This command will launch a local web server serving the main HTML file (src/js/index.html) and all the relevant assets.\nyarn build will launch the compilation with some optimizations for production. It copies all the static assets and the resulting bundle file in the dist folder.\nProject Structure\nIn this paragraph, we will try to explain the rules we defined and try to follow when talking about the structure of the project.\nSCSS Mixin\nIf you have to define SCSS mixin, you have to define them in the src/styles/mixin.scss file, and import them in the stylesheet of the React component.\nI18N\nIn order to avoid big i18n file, we try to split this file in smaller files, based on page or feature. For example, we have a src/js/i18n/dictionary/operations/documents.js file for all messages dedicated to the documents feature.\nThis files have to be imported directly or not in the main file js/i18n/dictionary/app.js.\n\n\n"},"user-guide/concept.html":{"url":"user-guide/concept.html","title":"Concept","keywords":"","body":"Bauhaus Concepts User Guide\nVersion on 19/03/2020\nThe Concepts module, also known as \"Bauhaus-concepts\", is used to manage concepts useful for statistical purposes.\nTable of contents\n\nBrowse the application\n\nConcept management tools\n\nSearch for a concept\nExport one or more concepts\nCreate a concept\nModify a concept\nCreate a new version\nCompare versions\nSend a concept\nPublish a concept\n\n\n\n\n\nConcept collection management tools\n\nSearch for a collection of concepts\nExport a collection of concepts\nCreate a collection of concepts\nModify a collection of concepts\nSend a collection of concepts\nPublish a collection of concepts\n\n\nAdministration\n\nMonitor the activity of the database\n\n\n\n\nBrowse the application\nTo reach the homepage of the concept management module, click on the module Concepts on the homepage.\nBrowsing is done with the horizontal menu bar at the top of the page.\nAny unit can ask for the creation of a concept. However, in order to guarantee the integrity and quality of the database, any creation or modification of a concept, as well as the identification of the owner, can only be done by the Quality unit. The publication is the responsibility of the owner identified in the application; it is up to him/her to organize the consultation with other users. In the application, the Quality unit is authorised to publish a concept on request of the owner.\nThe creation of a collection of concepts may be requested by any unit which need to bring together several concepts for a particular purpose (for exemple : documenting an Insee-Résultats). The requesting unit is the one that owns the collection, which may include concepts that it does not own. A concept can belong to several collections, and be used by several users in different collections. The owner of a collection can modify it at any time. In the application, the Quality unit is authorised to publish a collection on request of the owner.\nIn the application, four main user profiles have been created. Each one corresponds to a level of clearance giving access to different functionalities:\n\nApplication Administrator: access to all functionalities;\nManager of all the concepts: search, export, create, modify, send, publish a concept or collection, and compare versions of concepts;\nOwner of concept collection: search, export, create, modify, send or publish a collection;\nGuest (default profile for any user logging into the application): search, export, send a concept or collection, and compare versions of concepts.\n\nThe links to access the functionalities are displayed according to the user profile.\nFor any request or question, send an email to:\n:DG75-Administration RMéS\n\nConcept management tools\nSearch for a concept\nThe Concepts homepage, located on the horizontal menu bar, offers two search methods:\n\nA main search bar, which gives access to all the concepts registered in the application (1);\nA link to the advanced search page, which allows you to perform a refined search according to different criteria (2).\n\n\nThe main search bar is a search engine in which you can enter a sequence of letters corresponding to all or part of the title, acronym, short name or synonym you are looking for. The search starts automatically as letters are entered in the search bar.\n\nThe application generates a list of results under the search engine, on one or more pages depending on the number of concepts found.\nClick on the desired concept to access its description page. On this page, you can consult the English version by marking the box: [ ] Show second language. This will be displayed on the right of the French version.\n\nThe advanced search is available by clicking on Advanced search. To refine the selection:\n\nEnter the desired filters in the box:\n\nLabel: enter the label of the concept;\nAlternative label: enter the abbreviation, acronym, or synonym;\nSearch the definition: enter one or more words from the text of the definition in French;\nSelect the owner: select the unit to get the list of concepts under the responsibility of this unit;\nSelect a dissemination status, from the following choices:\nGeneric Audience (published in the Definitions section on insee.fr);\nSpecific audience (not published under Definitions, but available for documenting a publication);\nPrivate (internal use).\n\n\nSelect a publication status, from the following choices:\nPublished ;\nProvisional (being modified or awaiting publication).\n\n\nSelect the dates of the creation or the modification of the desired concept.\n\n\n\nThe search starts automatically as letters are entered in the filters. Click on the desired concept to access its description page.\nYou can consult the English version by marking the box: [ ] Show second language. This will be displayed on the right of the French version.\n\nExport one or more concepts\nIt is possible to export the description of one or more concepts from the Concepts homepage:\n\nClick on the button Export on the left of the page;\n\nScroll through the concepts list on the right to find the desired concepts, or use the search bar at the top of the list of concepts;\n\nClick on the button  of the concepts you want to export to integrate them into the left export block, or on the button  to remove them;\n\nOnce the concepts have been selected, click on Export on the top right of the page. A dialog box will open;\n\nSelect the desired format (PDF or ODT). The download window then opens with the options « open » and « save ». If several concepts are exported, there are as many files and download windows as there are exported concepts.\n\n\nNB: The ODT format allows you to exchange with other units for the editing of a definition, while the PDF format is for information purposes..\n\nCreate a concept\nBefore creating a concept, it is important to check that it has not already been recorded in the application by using the search tools.\nIt is possible to create a concept from the Concepts homepage.\n\nClick on the button New of the menu on the left of the page. The first page of the concept creation is then displayed.\n\nThe button Cancel takes you back to the Concepts homepage.\nThe button Save allows you to record the new concept in the database.\nNB: Saving is impossible as long as the required box, marked with a « \\ », have not been completed.*\nThree tabs are available to describe a concept: General Informations (1), Notes (2) and Links (3).\n\nThe tab General Informations allows you to fill various informations, including:\n\n\nThe « Label »: the label of the concept, mandatory to create a concept;\nThe « Alternative label »: the description, the acronym or the abbreviation (alternative names can be added or removed by clicking on + or -);\nThe « Owner »: the unit responsible for the description of the concept;\nThe « Contributor » : the unit authorized to create / modify the concept. This is the Quality unit (DG75-L201) which manages the concepts;\nThe « Dissemination status », which may be:\nPrivate: for internal use only;\nGeneric Audience: the concept is published in the « Definitions » section on insee.fr ;\nSpecific audience: distribution is restricted to documentation of publications and is not listed under Definitions.\n\n\nThe « Additional material »: allows you to insert a link to a web page;\nThe « Expiration »: must not be filled in when creating: once this date is filled, and it has been reached, the concept can no longer be changed.\n\nThe tab Notes allows you to fill various informations, including:\n\n\n\nShort definition: it generally repeats the first sentence of the definition, and must not be longer than 350 letters. The entry can be formatted with bullets points or numbers by clicking on the corresponding icons above the box. The short definition is mandatory for all concepts, except for those with the release status « Private »;\n\nDefinition: the definition is the long definition, and must begin by taking over the short definition in its entirety. The entry can be formatted with bullets points or numbers by clicking on the corresponding icons above the box;\n\nEditorial Note: it refers to the « Remarks » section of the definitions on insee.fr. Caution: it is not necessary to enter the word « Remarks » in the box, as this title is already provided on insee.fr;\n\nChange note: this is a short note for internal use, allowing for comments on the creation or modification of the definition. This « Change note » can be filled at any time, including at the creation of the concept, in particular to document the background of its creation.\n\nThe tab Links allows you to fill various informations, including:\n\n\n\nSeveral types of links allow you to browse the concepts. These links are meaningful and provide additional informations to the definition, and must be published with it. To add a link, choose the type of tab corresponding to the link you want to add, then scroll through the list of concepts on the right to find the desired link, or use the search bar at the top of the list of concepts. Click on the button  of the link to add, or the button  to remove it.\n\nThe tabs Parent and Child: they are hierarchical links that connect a general concept to more specific concepts and vice versa (for exemple : « Holidays » is the parent concept of « Summer holidays » and « Winter holidays »).\n\n\nNB: The insertion of a Parent link from concept A to concept B automatically creates the addition of a Child link from concept B to concept A. A parent concept can therefore have several child concepts, but a child concept can only have one parent concept.\n\nThe tab Reference: it allows you to set up hyperlinks to the concepts quoted in the definition. A concept can therefore reference several concepts.\n\nThe tab Replace: these links allow you to trace the history of the concept (for exemple: the RSA replaces the RMI, the microentrepreneur replaces the auto-entrepreneur, etc.). Adding a link Replace from Concept A to Concept B results in the creation of a link « is replace by » from Concept B to Concept A.\n\n\nNB: A concept can be replaced by one or more concepts, and vice versa.\n\nLinked tab: these links belong to the category « See also » and allow you to reach related concepts.\n\nThe button Save becomes active after completing the required boxes.\nCaution: Remember to save your work by clicking on the button at the top left before changing steps.\nIn addition, saving does not result in the publication of the concept. Indeed, it must first have been published by its owner, or by delegation (after exchange of mails) by the Quality unit. It is therefore possible, if necessary, to create a concept in several steps.\nThe release status of the concept then changes to « Provisional », until its publication.\nTo send the description of a concept by e-mail to a contact person (especially the owner), see Send concept.\nTo publish a concept to the repository, see Publish a concept.\n\nModify a concept\nIt is possible to modify a concept from its description page.\n\nClick in the upper right corner on the button Modify.\n\nThe various boxes can be modified, as described in the chapter Create a concept.\nOnce the concept is modified, the publication status of the concept then changes to « Provisional », until its publication. As long as it is not published in the repository (see Publish a concept), the old version remains available to the connected applications.\nChanging the notes « Short definition », « Definition » and « Editorial note » may result in the creation of new versions of these notes (see Create a new version).\n\nCreate a new version\nWhen you modify a short definition, a long definition or an editorial note of a concept, upon clicking on Save, a dialog box opens and asks you to choose between creating a new version or overwriting the current version.\n\nThe option « overwrite the current version » is used in the case of a simple modification, for example to correct the spelling or syntax of a definition or an editorial note.\n\nChanging a definition or an editorial note also changes the meaning of a concept. Thus, creating a new version makes it possible to keep track of previous definitions, so that successive versions can be compared.\n\n\nThe change note is mandatory to create a new version of the definition. This is a note for internal use: it is intended to keep track of the background of the modifications.\n\nTo continue, fill in the change note, then make the modifications as described in the chapter « Modify a concept ».\n\nNB: The versioning process is only activated when a published concept is modified. If the concept is awaiting publication (i.e. if its publication status is provisional), successive changes do not result in versioning. New definitions and notes overwrite old versions.\n\nCompare versions of a concept\nWhen multiple versions of a note exist (short definition, long definition or editorial note), you can compare them by clicking on the top left button Compare of the concept description page. A drop-down menu allows you to select the versions you want to compare.\n\nThe two selected versions are then displayed next to each other ;\n\nTo return to the current version, click on the top left on the button Return to the current version.\n\n\n\nSend a concept\nIt is possible to send a concept from the description page of a concept.\n\nClick on the button Send on the top of the page. A new page is then displayed, allowing you to send an email to a recipient with the description of the concept in ODT format as an attachment, as well as a link to the concept page in the application. The subject of the email and the text can be changed to personalize the message;\n\nNB: This service is not linked to the directory: you must enter the complete email address for all recipients.\n\nWhen the recipient's email address is filled and the text is ready, click on the button in the top right corner Send to send the email.\n\n\nPublish a concept\nIt is possible to publish a concept from the concept description page. Only the owner of the concept, or by delegation the Quality unit (after exchanging emails), is authorised to publish a concept.\n\nClick in the upper right corner on the button Publish after checking that the informations are correct.\n\nTo search for concepts awaiting publication, use the advanced search bar from the Concepts homepage by selecting the publication status « Provisional », and possibly the owner. The list of concepts awaiting publication is then automatically displayed under the search bar.\n\nConcept collection management tools\nSearch for a concept collection\nIt is possible to search for a collection from the homepage Collections in the horizontal menu bar. The page offers a search engine on all concept collections registered in the application.\n\nIn the search engine, you can enter a sequence of letters corresponding to all or part of the title, acronym, short name or synonym you are looking for. The search starts automatically as letters are entered in the search bar ;\n\nThe application generates a list of results under the search engine, on one or more pages depending on the number of concepts found ;\n\nThen click on the desired collection to access its description page. On this page, you can consult the English version by marking the box: [ ] Show second language. This will be displayed on the right of the French version.\n\n\n\nExport one or more concept collections\nIt is possible to export one or more concept collections from the homepage Collections.\n\nClick on the button Export on the left side of the page ;\n\nScroll through the list of collections on the right to find the desired collections, or use the search bar at the top of the list of collections ;\n\nClick on the button  of the collections you want to export to integrate them in the left export block, or on the button  to remove them ;\n\nOnce the collection(s) have been selected, click on Export in the top right ;\n\nA dialog box opens. Select the desired format (PDF or ODT). The download window then opens with the options « open » et « save ». If several collections are exported, there are as many files and download windows as there are exported collections.\n\n\n\nCreate a collection of concepts\nBefore creating a collection, it is important to check that it has not already been recorded in the application by using the search tools.\nIt is possible to create a collection of concepts from the homepage Collections.\n\nClick on the button New on the left side of the page. The first page for creating the collection is then displayed.\n\nThe button Cancel allows you to come back to the homepage of the Collections tab.\nThe button Save allows you to record the new collection in the database.\nNB: Saving is impossible as long as the required box, marked with a « \\ », have not been completed.*\n\nAt the bottom of the page, select the concepts you want to include in the collection by using the buttons  and  to add or remove them. To search for a concept, you can enter a sequence of letters corresponding to all or part of the title of the concept you are looking for in the search bar above the list.\n\nThe button Save becomes active after completing the required boxes.\nCaution: Remember to save your work by clicking on the button at the top right before changing steps.\nIn addition, saving does not result in the publication of the collection. Indeed, it must first have been published by its owner, or by delegation (after exchange of mails) by the Quality unit.
